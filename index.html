					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Haiii. I'm vi. I'm an artist, a writer, a second year student with a passion for creepy stuff. Go crazy. I am vi. I have many intrests, so much so I often get overwhelemed, by all the things are care about. I never feel like have enough time to attend and care for all my hobbies. Because of that I often forget skills I once learned. I just releared how to properly shuffle, with a bridge and everything! I love dedicating myself to new activities, I want to coontinue to collect experiences and abilities. Current focus: learning to code. ðŸ˜Ž</p>
