			<h1>Lab 4 - ✻ Pseudocoding and Problem-solving ✻</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>✫ Challenge ✫</h2>
					<p>The purpose of this lab was to create two pseudocodes: one of a simple task, another of a simple game. </p>	
				</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>✫ Problems ✫</h2>
					<p>We had some problems navigating css for the html file, as well as getting comfortable with using a variety of tags. 
						Luckily we could support eachother in our varying skill levels, and overcame any issues we faced.</p>
				</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>✫ Results ✫</h2>
					<div id="output"></div>
					<p>Pseudocode for making something out of air dry clay:</p>
					<pre><code>
						//Section off how much clay you will be using 
						//Wet it for a smoother texture
						//Shape into desired form
						//Let dry overnight
						//Paint it
						//Finish off with a sealant, such as mod podge
						//Admire your creation!
					</pre></code>
					<p>Pseudocode for the rock paper scissors game:</p>
					</p><pre><code>
					//Define both players and game rules
          					//computer vs. person
						//if player chooses rock and computer chooses scissors, player wins
							//else if computer chooses rock and player chooses scissors, computer wins
						//If player chooses scissors and computer chooses paper, player wins
							//else if computer chooses scissors and player chooses paper, computer wins
						//If player chooses paper and computer chooses rock, player wins
							//else if computer chooses paper and player chooses rock, computer wins
						//If both player and computer choose rock, they both tie
						//If both player and computer choose scissors, they both tie
						//If both player and computer choose paper, they both tie
					//Player inputs their choice
						//computer randomly picks rock, paper, or scissors
					//Delay for 1 second before both choices are revealed
						//If tie, no points are rewarded
					//Winner gets announced 
						</pre></code>
