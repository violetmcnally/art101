			<h1>Hello World</h1>
			<p> This lab was worked on by both Janesse and Violet. 
				We both shared a section together and decided to work together on this lab. 
				Janesse already had previous knowledge on html and css, so the lab was not too bad for them. 
				Violet has less coding experience, but was able to gain a lot more coding knowledge from this lab. 
				We were able to have an equal give and take while learning from one another.</p>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab we were supposed to create a basic HTML file and a CSS file to alter how our site looked.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> Meeting in person can be tricky when navigating two busy schedules, 
						but we were able to meet up over the weekend to finalize our work.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This was a fun lab, working with a template offered a great structure for us to code with. 
						I appreciated easing into our first lab that involved code. Partner Programming was so helpful, 
						we were able to easily work with one another, creating better work than we could have on our own. </p>
