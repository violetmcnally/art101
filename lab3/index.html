					<h2>Subject</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab was to create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html files.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p>I started this assignemnt on my own and ran into a few hiccups. I had some issues distiguishing which html file was my homepage and which was my lab 3. Because of that, I put my Homepage info into my Lab 3 and needed to rearrange my code after the fact. Once I was in section with my partner and TA I felt much more supported, being able to ask questions.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We were able to update our homepages using our new found coding skills, and link our labs in there. Builing a full site, rather than just a single homepage. I had so much fun playing around with CSS adjusting how I wanted my site to look, I hope you enjoy the essense of spring!</p>
