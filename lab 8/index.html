					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>I had to experiment a bit to get document.write() to work.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had to debug the site to get it to work, luckily we were able to work together and make that happen! </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This was a tough assignment, debugging this lab took a lot of time and different tactics. I am happy to be able 
						to work with a partner for these labs, pair programming has helped me to learn so much.
