				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>Working with your partner, write functions that take user input. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>This was tricky to navigate, we got stuck on the
					javascript for a bit there. Our button was present but not computing the output. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This took us much longer than we had expected.
					We spent a long time looking at different resources trying to figure out how to
					get the javascript to work. Eventually we were able to figure it out and you can see
					the fruits of our labor here on this site!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>The input form without an output is shown below:</p>
					<form>
						<label for="username">Input your name: </label><br>
						<input type="text" id="user-name" name="user-name"><br>
						<button type="button" id="my-button">Submit</button>
					</form>
					<div id="output">
