					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> We had to debug which is always a tricky tast when youre not sure what went wrong. 
                        We played around comparing out code untill we figured out what went wrong.

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was a necessary assignemnt. I remember looking back on my old lab unsure why it was no longer working,
						 when it worked at the time of submission. I'm glad it is now working! </p>
